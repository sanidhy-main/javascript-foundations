# JavaScript Foundations ⚡

This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript from the ground up, with a focus on core concepts that actually matter for real-world development.

The goal of this repo is to build a strong JavaScript base before moving into Node.js, Express, and backend development, without getting lost in framework magic too early.

This is a learning lab, not a production project.

---
# 🧭 Learning Philosophy
- Learn only what’s necessary before moving forward
- Focus on mental models, not memorization
- Use small, isolated examples (one concept per file)
- Avoid tutorials that hide logic behind abstractions
- Treat code itself as documentation

This repo exists to make JavaScript feel predictable, not magical.

# 🟦 Phase 1 — JavaScript Basics
- Variables (let, const)
- Functions (declaration vs arrow)
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Scope & hoisting (conceptual, not deep theory)

Goal: comfort with syntax and execution flow

---
# 🟦 Phase 2 — DOM Basics
- Selecting elements
- Event listeners
- Reading & updating the DOM
- Simple user interactions

Goal: understand how JavaScript talks to the browser

---

# 🟦 Phase 3 — Async JavaScript
- Callbacks (why they exist)
- Promises
- async / await
- fetch() and API calls

Goal: make async code feel linear and readable

---

# 🟦 Phase 4 — Working with Data
- JSON structure
- JSON.parse() / JSON.stringify()
- Handling API responses
- Passing data between functions

Goal: prepare for backend + frontend communication

---

# 🧠 Notes
- This repo is updated incrementally
- Commits reflect learning progress, not completion
- Code prioritizes clarity over clever tricks
- No frameworks here — just JavaScript

---

# 📌 Why this repo exists
This repository exists so that:
- JavaScript doesn’t feel chaotic or inconsistent
- Async code stops being scary
- Node.js and Express feel logical later
- Frontend concepts don’t become a blocker
